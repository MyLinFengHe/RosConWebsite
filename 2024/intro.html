<p>ROSCon 2024 will be held in Shenzhen, China from November 1st to 3rd, 2024. ROSCon 2024 is an opportunity for ROS developers of all levels, from beginners to experts, to spend three days learning from and networking with the ROS community. Get tips and tricks from experts and meet and share ideas with fellow developers.</p>

<p>ROSCon is a developer conference, similar to PyCon and BoostCon. Following the success of past events, this year’s ROSCon will be the thirteenth ROSCon and will be held in Shenzhen, China. Similar to previous years, the three-day program will include technical talks and tutorials that introduce new tools and libraries, as well as teach more about those you already know. The main program will consist of 10 to 30-minute presentations (some may be longer or shorter), as well as panel discussions, lightning talks, demonstrations, and workshops.</p>

<p>Our goal is for ROSCon to represent the entire ROS community, which is diverse and global. Whoever you are, whatever you do, and wherever you do it, if you’re interested in ROS, we want you to join us at ROSCon. We encourage women, members of minority groups, and other underrepresented groups to attend ROSCon. We expect all attendees to adhere to our code of conduct.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or ideas for ROSCon 2024, please contact the executive committee.</p>

<p>We also welcome suggestions for how to encourage more participation. If you have ideas to share, please contact us.</p>
